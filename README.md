# Articulation Points

## Overview

This project presents a comprehensive study on the identification of Articulation Points within networks through the application of various parallelization strategies. Articulation Points, also known as cut vertices, are critical nodes whose removal can significantly impact network connectivity. This study explores the implementation of parallelization techniques such as MapReduce, MPI, Spark, and MASS to efficiently analyze network structures and unveil these pivotal nodes.
